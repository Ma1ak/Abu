## Arabic support for Monkey programming language

Since Monkey supports Bitmap fonts. It is hard to implement Arabic. This module reshape the Arabic characters to re-order them. I am still not sure if I want to do this in Monkey which will translate to native or do it in all native languages which might result in better performance. Some benchmarks will be done to decide if it's worth the hassle or not.
